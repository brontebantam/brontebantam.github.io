title: Setting up a Github Blog

This is a quick post on how this blog was created.

This simple blog was forked from [jekyll-now](http://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) after following the instructions on [smashingmagazine.com]( https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/). 

From my 10 minute understanding of the settup process what we have is a static website with the content created in Markdown. The forked repository was renamed to my Github username master repo (https://brontebantam.github.io) and a few minutes later the site was automatically built and live.

This works as the forked repo contained the required [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) templates and configuration.  Github Pages is automatically configured to build, process and host Jekyll sites once you commit to a Github Pages or Organisation Pages repository.

For me thus far all I have done is make some simple configuration changes to the supplied "Hello world" examples and as the article followed suggested I added the [Prose](prose.io) extention to make the editing of markdown a little easier.

Perhaps in future I will install Jekyll (using the [Ruby](https://rubyinstaller.org/) cmd line) locally so I can customise and theme the blog a little more but for now I'm happy with the 10 minute setup and free hosting.
